  - Merry Christmas! Surprise! I got you a present! I wanted to be original this
    year and hid the present so you could search my cabin to find it. I'm a genius,
    so I rigged the house to open when certain things are placed in certain areas.
    Look for these notes to help you along the way. (Press Space to continue)
  - The notes are small white rectangles, so look carefully for them (The first one
    is on the door). Click on them to read and press Space to leave them. Also, you
    can open and close doors and drawers by pressing E, and move items by clicking
    and holding the left mouse button. Good Luck!
